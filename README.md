**PRACTICE PARTNER** - an app for music teachers and their students

Benjamin Franklin wrote, "in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes". (1789 - Thanks for the uplifting thought, Ben ;-)  I have another. Getting students to practice their musical instrument is usually a struggle. They don't know what to practice or how to practice. So they end up playing for 30 minutes and call it practicing.  Once they are practicing, getting them to practice correctly is the next battle.  With **PRACTICE PARTNER**, you can create a practice chart with the skills on which to focus, the order of those skills, and the ability to explain the assignment all in one app. **PRACTICE PARTNER** assists teachers to create, save, and assign a practice chart to one student or an ensemble of 100 students.  Each student has their own practice chart to guide their practicing.  It is like having a **PRACTICE PARTNER** in every practice session!
